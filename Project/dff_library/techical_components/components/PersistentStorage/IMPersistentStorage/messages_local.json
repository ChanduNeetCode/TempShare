If the existing wallet balance is more than or equal to the Auto Top-up threshold, then to activate the Auto Top-up during the setup process, Rs. 1 will be deducted from your account and credited to the UPI LITE wallet.\n2. If your linked account does not have sufficient balance and Auto Top-up fails, we will retry Auto Top-up after 1 hour.

If Auto Top-up attempts fail three times in a row, Auto Top-up will be paused till the end date.\n4. At any given time, the UPI LITE wallet can have up to Rs. 2000. Auto Top-up can fail if this limit is breached because of already setup threshold and Auto Top-up amount.\n5.
