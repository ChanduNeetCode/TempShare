The tax will be collected over and above the amount of cumulative remittance of INR 7 lakh in a financial year, effective from Oct 01, 2020. Additionally, as per the new regulatory guidelines, the higher TCS rate (upto 10%) will be applicable if the Income Tax Return for the last 2 years has not been timely filed, with effect from Jul 01, 2021. I authorise ICICI Bank unconditionally and irrevocably to recover such TCS amount, if applicable (over and above the amount authorised for the transaction), form the funds available in my ICICI Bank account including Joint Account/Forex Prepaid Card balances. I declare that the total amount of foreign exchange purchased from or remitted through all the sources in India, during the financial year, including this application is within the overall limit of the Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS) (currently USD 250,000); the limit prescribed by the Reserve Bank of India. In case the remittances are made beyond the permissible limit under LRS, ICICI Bank is authorised to take appropriate action, which includes blocking the card for international transactions and immediate repatriation of the excess funds. Your card will be blocked for further transactions if you have opened an Aadhar- OTP based account. Do complete your KYC by visiting your nearest Branch."

You shall be able to enable this feature only using the account using which you have created UPI LITE. You provide your consent to enable UPI LITE Auto Top-up. Your UPI LITE wallet will be automatically replenished using the account that you have linked.\n\nBelow are a few conditions that will be applicable during the Auto Top-up setup:\n1. If the existing wallet balance is more than or equal to the Auto Top-up threshold, then to activate the Auto Top-up during the setup process, Rs. 1 will be deducted from your account and credited to the UPI LITE wallet.\n2. If your linked account does not have sufficient balance and Auto Top-up fails, we will retry Auto Top-up after 1 hour. This process will be done three times, and if three subsequent Auto Top-up attempts fail, Auto Top-up will be paused till the end date.\n3. If Auto Top-up attempts fail three times in a row, Auto Top-up will be paused till the end date.\n4. At any given time, the UPI LITE wallet can have up to Rs. 2000. Auto Top-up can fail if this limit is breached because of already setup threshold and Auto Top-up amount.\n5. Auto top-up on UPI LITE wallet can be executed maximum 5 times a day.\nThe above-mentioned limits can be modified without any prior notice.\nYou shall have the right to revoke, modify, or pause UPI LITE Auto Top-up. Except as provided above, all terms provided with respect to iMobile shall be applicable to the Lite Auto Top-up.

If the existing wallet balance is more than or equal to the Auto Top-up threshold, then to activate the Auto Top-up during the setup process, INR 1 will be deducted from your account and credited to the UPI LITE wallet.\n\n2. At any given time, the UPI LITE wallet can have up to INR %1$s. Auto Top-up can fail if this limit is breached because of already setup threshold and Auto Top-up amount.\n\n3. Auto top-up to UPI LITE wallet has a daily limit of 5.\n\n4. UPI LITE is a device specific wallet. If you plan to change your device, then you should first close the existing LITE wallet in your phone so that LITE balance is transferred to your linked bank account.\n\nThe above-mentioned limits can be modified without any prior notice.\n\nYou shall have the right to revoke, modify, or pause UPI LITE Auto Top-up.
